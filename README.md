Project Overview:
This project is a part of my internship at CodeClause and represents a GUI-based alarm clock developed using Python's tkinter library. It offers an intuitive user interface for setting multiple alarms and conveniently checking the current time.

Features:
Multiple Alarms: Users can set multiple alarms, each with a unique time and label.
Real-Time Clock Display: The graphical user interface (GUI) continuously displays the current time, ensuring users are always informed.
Alarm Activation: When an alarm is set, a checkbox must be activated.
Alarm Trigger: The alarm rings for 20 seconds starting from the set time, accompanied by an audible alert.
Deactivation: After the alarm duration, the checkbox should be turned off.

How It Works:
Set Alarms: Users can easily add and manage alarms by specifying the desired time and optional labels.
Real-Time Clock: The GUI keeps users informed of the current time.
Alarm Activation: Upon setting an alarm, the corresponding checkbox is activated.
Alarm Trigger: At the specified time, the alarm rings for 20 seconds.
Deactivation: After 20 seconds, the checkbox should be turned off, signifying that the alarm has been triggered and acknowledged.

Project Goals:
Develop a user-friendly GUI alarm clock application.
Provide users with the ability to set multiple alarms.
Enhance user experience with real-time clock display and automatic alarm deactivation.

Learning Outcomes:
Proficiency in Python's tkinter library for GUI development.
Implementation of a functional alarm system with timing and user interface elements.
Improved problem-solving skills through addressing real-world programming challenges.

Dependencies:
Python (3.0 recommended)
tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)
